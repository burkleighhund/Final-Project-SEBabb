Music Lessons On Demand
*A former Music Teachers wish for a simpler and easier to access supplemental lessons guide

This project is meant to provide an easier, more affordable/accessible way to supplement music lessons across grade levels. Specifically this program should let a student find the lessons they need based on instructor, instrument, and grade level. It should also allow instructors to post content based off of the same constraints.
