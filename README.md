Music Lessons On Demand

*A former Music Teachers wish for a simpler and easier to access supplemental lessons guide

This project is meant to provide an easier, more affordable/accessible way to supplement music lessons across grade levels. Specifically, this program should let a student find the lessons they need based on instructor, instrument, and grade level. It should also allow instructors to post content based off of the same constraints.

**The Supporting Files/Constraints*


-**pytest**: This is a testing framework based on Python that is mainly used to write API test cases (This is the API portion of my project)

-**SQLalchemy**: This is the Python SQL toolkit and object relational mapper I used in my project to help me utilize SQL without connecting straight to SQlite browser.

-**python**: This one is self explanatory, but for those who aren't aware, Python is a high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.

-**unittest**: This is a framework package inside of Python that makes my code future proof. Basically it helps me anticipate the cases where my code could fail or potentially produce a bug.

-**AbstractMethod**, **ABC**: This is a method in python that is declared but contains no implementation. 

*This repository is made to be a smaller version of Dane's testing example.There is the following:

    #Layered Architecture

    At the base level, the architecture is designed with a layered effect which include these elements:
        -**Presentation**:(will be a module called music.py here)
        -**Business Logic Layer**: (will be a module called tests.py here)
        -**Presistence Layer**:(will be a module called program.py here)

Instead of connecting straight to an SQlite browser, I attempted to build a pseudo table inside a Virtual Environment. I focused mostly on the actual testing implementation though rather than the full program for this project.
